## About InvenPro
Originally just a collection of python scripts coded to parse and organize information from excel sheets, **InvenPro** grew into a full fledged project/software that allows the user to keep track of inventory and items easily. Development of InvenPro began in the summer of 2021. InvenPro served as a learning experience and an opportunity to dive into **GUI**, **File IO**, **Local Storage**, **User Testing**, etc. in a professional and use heavy environment.

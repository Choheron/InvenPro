# InvenPro - MASLD
**InvenPro** is an inventory program built entirely in **Python**, created for "Mid Atlantic Surveying and Land Design" and currently in use to keep inventory. 

## Features
* The ability to create new categories and items, allowing for the addition and removal of attributes as needed.
* Storage of all changes and information locally, in Json files.
* The ability to export data to Excel sheets for Tax or Archive reasons.

## About InvenPro
Originally just a collection of python scripts coded to parse and organize information from excel sheets, **InvenPro** grew into a full fledged project/software that allows the user to keep track of inventory and items easily. Development of InvenPro began in the summer of 2021. InvenPro has served as a learning experience and an opportunity to dive into **GUI**, **File IO**, **Local Storage**, **User Testing**, etc. in a professional and use heavy environment.

## Developed by [Thomas Campbell](https://thomascampbell.dev/)
* Built in python, due to pythons ease of interaction with Excel and Json files, InvenPro uses **Tkinter**, **Pillow**, **Openpyxl** and more.
* InvenPro is built to function perfectly for the MASLD inventory structure and conventions.
